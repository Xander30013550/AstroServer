# üåå Astronomical Processing Project

**Author:** Xander Smith  
**Date:** 22/8/25  

This project is developed for **Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS)** as part of the Astronomical Processing Project. The solution replaces the existing socket-based system with a modern **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** design using **Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)** with Named Pipes.  

The system provides astronomical calculation services via a **server console application**, a **WinForms client application**, and a custom **third-party library (AstroMath.DLL)**.

## üöÄ Project Components

- **AstronomicalProcessingServer**  
  Console application that runs continuously. Provides services via WCF Named Pipes.  

- **AstronomicalProcessingClient**  
  WinForms application (.NET Framework) that connects to the server, accepts user input, displays validated results, and supports multi-language and UI customisation.  

- **AstroMath.DLL**  
  Custom-built library providing:  
  1. Star Velocity  
  2. Star Distance  
  3. Temperature Conversion (Celsius ‚Üî Kelvin)  
  4. Blackhole Event Horizon
